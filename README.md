# Aim
At the time of me making this, I found that these might be some cool feature-extensions, that I felt, were incomplete/missing from Java.

# Who is for?
Anyone who, like me, wants to 'fill-in' some missing features, but (like me) doesn't know/want to contribute to the main language. Feel free to use and add.
